# Docker Compose Microservices Troubleshooting

## Scenario Overview

You've been called to fix a broken microservices architecture that was hastily deployed to production. The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: Nginx serving static content
- **API**: Node.js backend service
- **Database**: MySQL for persistent storage
- **Cache**: Redis for session and caching

## The Problem

The development team reports multiple issues:
- Services cannot communicate with each other
- Database connections are failing
- Redis authentication is broken
- Frontend cannot reach the API
- Docker Compose file has permission issues
- Misconfigured application settings

## Your Mission

1. **Fix File Permissions**: Restore access to the docker-compose.yml file
2. **Analyze the Architecture**: Understand service dependencies and network topology
3. **Fix Network Configuration**: Ensure all services can communicate properly
4. **Correct Service Configuration**: Fix environment variables, ports, and dependencies
5. **Verify Components**: Ensure all services have required configurations
6. **Test the Stack**: Verify all services are running and connected

## Available Tools

- `docker-compose` - Orchestrate multi-container applications
- `docker ps` - List running containers
- `docker logs` - View container logs
- `docker network ls` - List Docker networks
- `docker exec` - Execute commands in containers
- `nano/vim` - Edit configuration files

## Success Criteria

- All services start without errors
- Services can communicate on proper networks
- Database and cache are accessible from API
- Frontend can reach the API endpoints
- No port conflicts or permission issues
- Stack is production-ready
