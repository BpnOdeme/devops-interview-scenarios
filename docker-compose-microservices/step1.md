# Step 1: Analyze the Architecture

## Task

First, let's understand the current state of the microservices architecture and identify all issues.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /root/microservices
   ```

2. Fix the permission issue:
   ```bash
   ls -la docker-compose.yml
   chmod 644 docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Examine the Docker Compose configuration:
   ```bash
   cat docker-compose.yml
   ```

4. Check existing Docker networks:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```

5. List the project structure:
   ```bash
   tree . || ls -la
   ```

6. Check the reference configuration:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/reference/docker-compose-reference.yml
   ```

## What to Look For

### Common Issues in Microservices Architecture:
- **Network Isolation**: Services on different networks cannot communicate
- **Service Naming**: Environment variables must match actual service names
- **Port Mappings**: Format is `host:container`, not reversed
- **Dependencies**: Services must be in correct start order
- **Volume Mounts**: Application code must be mounted into containers

### Identified Problems:
1. Frontend and API are on different networks
2. API uses wrong service names for DB and Redis
3. Database port configuration mismatch
4. Redis port mapping is reversed
5. Missing application code mounts
6. Network driver incompatibility

## Documentation

Make notes of all issues you find:
- [ ] Permission issues
- [ ] Network configuration problems
- [ ] Service name mismatches
- [ ] Port configuration errors
- [ ] Missing volumes
- [ ] Environment variable issues

Once you've identified all issues, proceed to the next step.
