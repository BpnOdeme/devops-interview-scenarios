# Nginx Load Balancer Scenario Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-09-09

## Summary
The nginx-loadbalancer scenario has been thoroughly tested and is working correctly with some minor improvements needed.

## Test Results

### 1. Scenario Structure ✅
- All required files are present
- Setup script correctly creates backend servers
- Configuration files follow proper structure

### 2. Intentional Errors (Working as Designed) ✅
The scenario correctly introduces the following errors for troubleshooting practice:
- Missing semicolons in upstream server definitions
- Typo: `ip_hsh` instead of `ip_hash`
- Typo: `prox_pass` instead of `proxy_pass`
- Missing semicolon in access_log directive
- Commented out important proxy headers
- Conflicting server blocks

### 3. Load Balancing Functionality ✅
- **Round-robin**: Working correctly
- **Weighted distribution**: Backend 2 (weight=2) receives 2x traffic as expected
- **IP Hash**: Working correctly for session persistence
- **Failover**: Automatic removal of failed backends confirmed

### 4. Health Checks ✅
- `/health` endpoint returns proper JSON response
- Passive health checks working (failed backends automatically removed)
- Active health checks would require Nginx Plus

### 5. Monitoring ✅
- `/nginx-status` endpoint working correctly
- Proper access control (localhost only)
- Returns connection statistics

### 6. Verification Scripts ⚠️
- **verify-step1.sh**: ✅ Working correctly
- **verify-step2.sh**: ⚠️ Uses systemctl which doesn't work properly in container
- **verify-step3.sh**: ✅ Working correctly

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues
1. **verify-step2.sh** relies on `systemctl is-active` which doesn't work in the container environment
   - **Recommendation**: Use `pgrep nginx` or check for nginx process directly

2. **Docker Setup** not included in original scenario
   - **Added**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy testing

## Best Practices Validated

### Configuration Best Practices ✅
- Proper upstream block syntax
- Correct proxy headers for reverse proxy
- Consistent timeout formats
- HTTP/1.1 and connection headers for keepalive
- Access logging control
- Security through access restrictions

### Load Balancing Best Practices ✅
- Multiple load balancing algorithms available
- Weight-based traffic distribution
- Automatic failover on backend failure
- Health check endpoints

## Improvements Implemented

### Fixed Configuration Includes:
```nginx
# All server directives with proper semicolons
server 127.0.0.1:8081 weight=1;

# Correct load balancing method
ip_hash;

# Essential proxy headers
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

# Keepalive optimization
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Connection "";
```

## Testing Commands Used

```bash
# Configuration validation
nginx -t

# Load balancing test
for i in {1..20}; do 
  curl -s http://localhost:9080 | grep -o "Backend Server [0-9]"
done | sort | uniq -c

# Health check test
curl -s http://localhost:9080/health

# Status monitoring
curl -s http://127.0.0.1/nginx-status
```

## Conclusion

The nginx-loadbalancer scenario is **production-ready** for training purposes with minor improvements needed for the verification script. The scenario effectively teaches:
- Nginx configuration troubleshooting
- Load balancing concepts
- Health check implementation
- Monitoring setup
- Best practices for reverse proxy configuration

## Recommendations

1. Update verify-step2.sh to use process checking instead of systemctl
2. Consider adding more complex scenarios like SSL termination or cache configuration
3. Add documentation about Docker setup for easier testing
4. Consider adding rate limiting configuration as an advanced topic
