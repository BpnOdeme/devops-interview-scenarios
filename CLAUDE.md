# Software Development Best Practices

- Always develop with clean code principles and clean architecture
- Focus on maintaining a clear, maintainable, and scalable code structure
- Pay attention to naming conventions. Apply them in every operation you perform

## User Interaction Memories

- When asked to show user memories, write out the existing memories from the file
- When asked what was previously added, display the content that was previously added to the memory file

## Git Workflow

- Her git commit atmadan önce mutlaka rootdaki CLAUDE.md file güncelle
- Her commit atıldığında root dizindeki CLAUDE.md file güncelle, md fileları güncelle

## Recent Work - Docker Compose Microservices Scenario (2025-09-09)

### Comprehensive Microservices Architecture Implementation

#### Created complete microservices ecosystem with:

1. **API Gateway Service** (Port 3000):
   - Express.js based central routing
   - Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
   - Security headers with Helmet.js
   - HTTP proxy middleware for service routing
   - Comprehensive logging with Winston
   - Health check endpoints

2. **User Service** (Port 3001):
   - User registration and authentication
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - MongoDB for user data persistence
   - Redis for session management
   - Input validation with Joi
   - RESTful API endpoints

3. **Product Service** (Port 3002):
   - Product catalog management
   - Inventory tracking with stock operations
   - Category management
   - Redis caching for performance
   - Full-text search with MongoDB indexes
   - Pagination support
   - Soft delete functionality

4. **Order Service** (Port 3003):
   - Order processing workflow
   - Integration with Product Service for inventory
   - RabbitMQ for event publishing
   - Order status management
   - Payment status tracking
   - Order history with status timeline
   - User order retrieval

5. **Frontend Dashboard**:
   - Real-time service health monitoring
   - Interactive testing interface
   - Service status indicators
   - Test data creation buttons
   - Responsive modern UI
   - Connection status for each service

6. **Infrastructure Components**:
   - MongoDB: Separate databases per service
   - Redis: Caching and session store
   - RabbitMQ: Message queue for async communication
   - Nginx: Frontend serving and reverse proxy
   - Docker networking with isolated subnets

#### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear service boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error responses
- **Logging**: Winston logger integration across all services
- **Validation**: Joi schema validation for all inputs
- **Security**: JWT authentication, bcrypt hashing, Helmet.js headers
- **Health Checks**: All services expose /health endpoints
- **Docker Setup**: Individual Dockerfiles optimized for production
- **Environment Management**: Proper .env configuration examples
- **Network Isolation**: Services communicate through Docker bridge network

#### Troubleshooting Scenario Features:
- Intentionally broken setup.sh for learning purposes
- Missing api/index.js file to simulate common issues
- Network configuration problems to solve
- Service name mismatches in docker-compose
- Port mapping errors
- File permission issues
- Database connection challenges

#### Benefits:
- Production-ready microservices architecture
- Scalable and maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security best practices implementation
- Easy testing with interactive dashboard
- Real-world troubleshooting experience
